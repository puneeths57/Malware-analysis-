**RMDNet** is a deep learning framework designed for malware detection and classification across multiple datasets. It leverages advanced deep learning techniques to identify and categorize malware samples with high accuracy. This project focuses on three distinct datasets and includes methods for binary visualization of malware images. The goal is to provide a robust tool for cybersecurity professionals and researchers to enhance malware detection capabilities.
Datasets
This project utilizes the following datasets for training and evaluation:

**Dataset-1:** Binary Visualization of Images
Description: This dataset consists of binary images representing malware samples. Each image is generated from malware binaries to facilitate pattern recognition through visual analysis.

**Malimg Dataset (Dataset-2)**
Description: Malimg is a well-known dataset of malware images derived from disassembled binary code. It contains various malware families and is widely used for malware classification tasks.

**Dumpware 10 (Dataset-3)**
Description: Dumpware 10 includes malware samples categorized into ten different families. This dataset provides a diverse range of malware types for comprehensive evaluation and testing.
